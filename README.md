This is an STL for the housing of an optosensor/pickoff of the sonar models of sx-70/680/690 cameras. This is still a work in progress and may not work in conjunction with the components that go inside it quite yet. Once I get the prints and test them, I will make changes accordingly.

This print requires two components. The LTR-301 phototransistor and the LTE-302 IR emitter. The LTE-302 goes in the slot that has the flanges at the side and the LTR-301 goes in the side with the small opening hole in the center of the part.

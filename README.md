This is an STL for the housing of an optosensor/pickoff of the sonar models of sx-70/680/690 cameras. This is still a work in progress and may not work in conjunction with the components that go inside it quite yet. Once I get the prints and test them, I will make changes accordingly.

This print requires two components. The LTR-301 phototransistor and the LTE-302 IR emitter. These are the same components that were used by Matt from 2nd Shot sx70, meaning that these components are known to function fully as the elecronics of the sx-70 optosensor. The LTR-301 goes in the slot that has the flanges at the side and the LTE-302 goes in the side with the small opening hole in the center of the part.
